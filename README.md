# HeightmapFromTexture
HeightmapFromTexture for unity.

i just did some user Interface improvement and conversion to cSharp on this wiki code : http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=HeightmapFromTexture .

you need to make sure to mark your texture as "read/write enabled"in import setting.

you should put this script inside "Editor" folder.
